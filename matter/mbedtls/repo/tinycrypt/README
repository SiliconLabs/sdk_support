Overview:

The TinyCrypt Library provides an implementation for constrained devices of a 
minimal set of standard cryptography primitives. 

This is a modified form of the library based on version 0.2.8 included as part
of Mbed TLS as a compilation option. It is not included in its full form and
those wishing to use TinyCrypt should use the original unmodified project.

The original project can be found here: https://github.com/intel/tinycrypt

Contributions should be made upstream to that project, and full documentation 
can be found in the originating repository.

================================================================================

Organization:

tinycrypt: C source code of the cryptographic primitives.
include/tinycrypt: C header files of the cryptographic primitives.

No documentation is provided, and instead is available with the original
project.

Tests are provided as part of Mbed TLS and the Mbed TLS test suites.

================================================================================

Building:

To include TinyCrypt as part of Mbed TLS, enable the configuration option
MBEDTLS_USE_TINYCRYPT in the configration file 'include/mbedtls/config.h', and
build as Mbed TLS as normal.
