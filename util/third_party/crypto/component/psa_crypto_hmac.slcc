label: PSA Crypto support for HMAC
description: 
  "This component provides support for hash-based message authentication codes \
  (HMACs) in PSA Crypto.\n

  At the moment, it is not possible to have HMAC hardware accelerated through PSA \
  Crypto; this means that the 'Mbed TLS Support for \ HMAC' component is required \
  for this functionality to be available."
