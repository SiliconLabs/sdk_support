label: PSA Crypto support for HKDF
description:
  "This component provides support for key derivation using HKDF in PSA Crypto.\n

  If hardware acceleration of HKDF is available and the 'Mbed TLS Support for \
  HKDF' component is not included, PSA will not enable fallback to the software \
  implementation (which in this case uses the HMAC API) in the Mbed TLS library."
