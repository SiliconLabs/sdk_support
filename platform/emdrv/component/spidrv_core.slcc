description: >
  The SPI driver sets up the USART for SPI communication and supports
  both master and slave roles. Both blocking and interrupt driven asynchrounous
  APIs are provided for transmit and receive operations.


  This component includes only the SPI driver core. To configure and create
  instances of this driver, the SPIDRV component should be included in the 
  project.
